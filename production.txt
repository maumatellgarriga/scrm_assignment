Answer of the question about productize the ETL.

First of all, during the whole process of writing the code of the ETL I would use git as a version control system. 
For that we could use Github, Bitbucket or similar tools. We would create a branch for every new feature
we want to include in the project and a master branch.

For automatically deploying the changes I would prepare a CI/CD pipeline in the cloud of preference. 
We would set a trigger that whenever a new Pull Request is created for a feature, a set of unit and integration tests are run.
It would also trigger a set of style and format checks such as black, pylint, etc in Python to unify the style through the team.
When all checks and tests has run we could push the code into the master branch, so we would have our new feature 
running in production. 

Software regression would be prevent through the set of tests run over the code and having a contract for each layer of the data. 
For that we would expect to have a high test coverage of the project, which the team should agree on. The team should also agree on how to
set up the contracts and follow them.
